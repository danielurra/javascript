JavaScript has nothing to do with Java they are two independent programming languages<br/>
JavaScript was created by Netscape, it is basically the browser implementation of the specification ECMAScript<br>
To the server, JavaScript code is merely text, just like HTML. To the web browser, however, this<br>
text has special meaning that can be interpreted differently, JavaScript has become one of the pillars of the Web.<br>
You can write *client-side* programs to be executed in the web browser<br>
Modern browsers support core JavaScript, DOM manipulation, the XmlHttpRequest object (used to make Ajax requests), and basic CSS. <br>
In sum, modern browsers are capable of making the most of today’s dynamic Web technologies. <br>
JavaScript changes the browser from an application for displaying documents to a platform for writing applications.<br>
It’s useful because it enables the developer to manipulate the contents of a web page after it has loaded, making it possible<br>
 to provide users with instant feedback when they make a change in a form.<br>
Loading resources on demand for performance reasons, or building full-blown user interfaces that resemble desktop applications.<br>
JavaScript uses what’s referred to as an `event-driven` model of execution. When you embed JavaScript code in a web page, <br>
it isn’t run until the event it’s associated with is triggered.<br>
JavaScript is useful because it’s deeply integrated with the browser.<br>
This integration allows programmers to manipulate various aspects of the browser behavior, as well as objects included on the page.<br>
JavaScript uses what’s referred to as an event-driven model of execution. <br>
When you embed JavaScript code in a web page, it isn’t run until the event it’s associated with is triggered.<br>
The types of events that can call JavaScript include <br>
* loading the page, 
* leaving the page, 
* interacting with a form element in some way, 
* clicking a link, or even just 
 *scrolling up or down. <br>
Plenty of other events are available, too.<br>
